# flexbox-web-page

This is my first web page with Flexbox.
The primary purpose of this website is to display the capability of Flexbox, and to showcase how I can implement it in practice as well as being a milestone for my learning.
I started learning coding a month ago and the entire code is written only with basic HTML and CSS, which are the only resources that I can use at this moment.
As for CSS, I will primarily be using Flexbox for page layout and will not be using any Grid.
